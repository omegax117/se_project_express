# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

This project contains the back end and server routing structure for the What to wear website. This routes user requests for the functionality of the site and properly communicates with a server to update and run the website. This project also handles all errors that a user might encounter with requests in order to properly communicate how to handle them.

This project runs an express framework for it's functionality and uses ESlint to help validate and format the code.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
